### Authentication Service with Eureka and Docker

This document provides setup instructions and configuration for the Authentication Service, which includes JWT-based authentication, email service integration, Eureka service registration, and PostgreSQL in Docker. 


---

### **1. Overview** üåç
This Authentication Service supports user registration, login, email activation, password reset, and JWT token validation. It uses **Eureka** for service registration and **Docker** for containerization. Additionally, the email service is integrated to send activation emails to users.

---

### **2. Service Architecture** üèóÔ∏è

- **Authentication Service**: Responsible for managing user accounts and generating JWT tokens.
- **Eureka Server**: A service registry used for discovering services.
- **Email Service**: Sends activation emails to users after they register.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database used to store user data.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the entire stack (PostgreSQL and the application).

---

### **3. Prerequisites** üìã

- **Eureka Server** and **Email Service** need to be set up and running before starting the Authentication Service.

#### **3.1 Setting Up Eureka Server** üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone the [Eureka Server repository](https://github.com/Kaweesha-mr/service-registry) or use an existing Eureka server.
2. Run the Eureka Server. The default port for Eureka is `8761`. Make sure it‚Äôs up and running.

#### **3.2 Setting Up Email Service** üìß

1. Clone the [Email Service repository](https://github.com/Kaweesha-mr/mail-service-template).
2. Build and run the Email Service locally or deploy it on a cloud service.
3. Ensure that the Email Service is properly integrated with your application, and update the `.env` file with the email service name (`EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME=NODEJS-MAIL-SERVICE`).

#### **3.3 Service Registration in Eureka** üîó

1. In the **Authentication Service**, add the `@EnableEurekaClient` annotation to the main application class to enable service registration with Eureka.
2. The Authentication Service will automatically register itself in Eureka when it starts.

---

### **4. Setup & Installation** ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to set up and install the Authentication Service.

#### **4.1 Clone the Repository** üíª

Clone the Authentication Service repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaweesha-mr/authentication-service.git
cd authentication-service
```

#### **4.2 Set Up the Environment Variables** üå±

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
APPLICATION_PORT=8080
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/auth
DATABASE_USERNAME=your_database_username
EMAIL_SERVICE_NAME=NODEJS-MAIL-SERVICE
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

#### **4.3 Running the Application** üöÄ

Run the Spring Boot application using:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### **4.4 Running the Application with Docker** üê≥

If you want to run the entire stack using Docker, including PostgreSQL and the Authentication Service, follow the instructions below.

---

### **5. Docker Setup** üèóÔ∏è

The Authentication Service and PostgreSQL can be run in Docker containers using `docker-compose`. The following `docker-compose.yml` file sets up the containers for PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.

#### **5.1 Docker Compose Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

Create or update your `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: postgres_container
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: test
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 1234
      POSTGRES_DB: auth
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - mynetwork

  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    container_name: pgadmin_container
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: admin
    ports:
      - "5050:80"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - mynetwork

  auth-service:
    image: your-auth-service-image
    container_name: auth_service
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/auth
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=test
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=1234
      - JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - mynetwork

volumes:
  postgres_data:

networks:
  mynetwork:
    driver: bridge
```

#### **5.2 Running Docker Compose** üö¢

1. To start the entire application stack, use the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. This will bring up the PostgreSQL container, pgAdmin (for managing the database), and the Authentication Service. The PostgreSQL container will be available on `localhost:5432`, and pgAdmin will be accessible on `localhost:5050`.
